## Math background

I like Math.
No CS background.

## What I expect to gain from CS curriculum

- Interview competency
- How to *think* like a programmer/developer
- How to solve problems *better*
- Continue on journey towards Mastery
 - Mastery as defined by George Leonard
  > Definition of mastery: the mysterious process during which what is at first difficult becomes progressively easier and more pleasurable through practice.

I’d like you to have a README.md in the root directory of that repository with a few sentences about any math or CS background you have. Then create a bulleted list (good markdown practice) of what you hope to gain from learning CS. Push this to github. We’ll review this by Wednesday’s class. So you have 2 days to complete this.
