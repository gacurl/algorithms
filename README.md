# algorithms

## Math background

I like Math.
No CS background.

## What I expect to gain from CS curriculum

- Interview competency
- How to *think* like a programmer/developer
- How to solve problems *better*
- Continue on journey towards Mastery
  - Mastery as defined by George Leonard
   > Definition of mastery: the mysterious process during which what is at first difficult becomes progressively easier and more pleasurable through practice.
